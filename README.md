# Food_Delivery_Management_Application

For this application we are given a .csv file with a bunch of products and nutritional values (including duplicates) and I used Java Streams and Regex in order to filter the data and show it to the client in clean matter. The client can place orders and the admin can add items to the menu and create composite products.
